I am Bella and i'm excited to begin this new experience. Didn't know where to begin but the guide was sure helpful and i'm already enjoying the experience. 

I choose the project 'Improve diagnostics of typhoid through Open Science: An Artificial Intelligence based-technique' because i have seen so many persons around me suffer from typhoid and i have been a victim too. 

The general impression i get from most people is that typhoid is an ever present disease in every person because each time one goes for the widal test, its almost always positive.

Therefore, working on this project is a great opportunity for me to contribute to the resolution of a health issue in my community. 

I can't wait to take the next step.
